# Problem description
Your goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their xyz and seasonal flu
vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: one for xyz_vaccine and
one for seasonal_vaccine.

# Performance metric
Performance will be evaluated according to the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (ROC AUC) for each of the two target variables. The mean of
these two scores will be the overall score. A higher value indicates stronger
performance.

# I got AUC-ROC score of 0.9999996894895279
